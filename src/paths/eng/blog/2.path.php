                <h1 class="title">Let's talk about RETINOIDS.</h1>
                <p>
                    You have already heard on social networks that even the neighbor is talking about "Retinoids".
                </p>
                <p>
                    They recommend them to prevent aging, remove wrinkles, fine lines, blemishes, facial oil, acne... in short.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is true: they are a very varied group of active ingredients, they are widely used in dermatology and other branches of medicine, their milder molecules are used in cosmetics, they have many effects on skin cells e.g. SEBOCYTE, MELANOCYTE, CHERATINOCYTE and even on immune system cells and some mutated or cancer cells...
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Not all molecules have the same action, some are better for one condition and others for others, some are more irritating.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    -That is why we must respect them and never self-medicate them (at least not their exclusive forms for medical use) since they are a MEDICATION, with varied effects and side effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Even their mild forms present in cosmetic products (retinol, retinaldehyde or retinyl palmitate) can cause side effects and if not used properly can irritate or stain.
