                <p>
                    Sunscreen is a cream that has to be in our daily kit yes or yes, and to know what is an ideal option below I will let you know the basic features to look for when buying sunscreen.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1Ô∏è‚É£ The texture that you like the most and adapts to your habits and lifestyle because you can have the best sunscreen but if you don't like it, you won't wear it, so, try it until you find the ideal one.

                    <li>
                        2Ô∏è‚É£ SPF (sunscreen factor) of 30 or more, on the actual labeling the maximum SPF will look like 50+, this will indicate how well it protects your skin against sunburn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3Ô∏è‚É£Broad spectrum: the main thing will be protection from UVB, the most biologically active causing sunburn, UVA which is the one found in same amount on cloudy days, shade and going through windows, also it penetrates deeper causing spots and aging by degeneration of collagen fibers. It can also be against blue light (visible light or HEVL) and infrared radiation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4Ô∏è‚É£ Water Resistance üí¶ (40-80min) and eye üëÅ this does not mean that it is waterproof but it will resist more sweat or humidity of the environment, for such reason it is necessary to reapply after profuse sweating and swimming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5Ô∏è‚É£Antioxidants, is a cherry on the cake üçí üç∞ very useful as they can quickly neutralize those photons (radiant light units) that leak despite the sunscreen and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that directly damage DNA üß¨.
                    </li>
